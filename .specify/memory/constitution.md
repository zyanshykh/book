# Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Readable Prose

Every chapter MUST prioritize reader comprehension through clear, concise writing. Sentences SHOULD be direct and avoid unnecessary jargon. Complex concepts MUST be explained before introducing related terminology. Paragraphs MUST focus on single ideas with smooth transitions between topics. Technical precision MUST NOT sacrifice accessibility.

Rationale: Readers come to learn, not to decode. Clear writing respects their time and cognitive load.

### II. Code Examples

Every code example MUST be functional, tested, and educational. Code MUST run without modification in a well-defined environment. Examples MUST illustrate concepts in context, not as isolated snippets. Complex code MUST include inline comments explaining non-obvious logic. Each example SHOULD have a clear learning objective stated before the code block.

Rationale: Readers learn by doing. Broken or confusing examples frustrate learning and erode trust in the material.

### III. Modular Structure

Every chapter MUST be self-contained and independently valuable. Chapters MUST build on previous material without requiring knowledge of later sections. Core concepts MUST be accessible from early chapters for quick reference. Subsections MUST be clearly labeled with logical progressions. Cross-references MUST point to specific sections, not assume sequential reading.

Rationale: Readers reference books non-linearly. Self-contained modules support both sequential learning and quick lookup.

### IV. Consistent Voice

The entire book MUST maintain a unified tone, balancing professionalism with approachability. The narrative voice MUST remain consistent across all chapters and examples. Technical depth MUST increase progressively, but tone SHOULD remain steady. First-person plural ("we") SHOULD be used consistently for instructional guidance.

Rationale: Inconsistent voice disrupts immersion and creates cognitive friction for readers.

### V. Progressive Complexity

Each chapter MUST introduce concepts in order of increasing complexity. Foundational ideas MUST be thoroughly explored before building advanced topics. Every new concept MUST connect to previously introduced material. Chapter exercises MUST reinforce core concepts before introducing variations.

Rationale: Readers retain information better when concepts build logically on prior knowledge.

### VI. Actionable Learning

Every chapter MUST conclude with clear takeaways and hands-on practice. Each major section SHOULD include exercises that reinforce key concepts. Takeaways MUST be specific, actionable, and measurable. Summary checklists MUST help readers verify their understanding before proceeding.

Rationale: Active learning transforms passive reading into skill acquisition.

## Writing Standards

**Voice and Tone**: Write as an expert mentor guiding a curious learner. Be precise but not condescending, enthusiastic but not hyperbolic. Avoid hedge words like "probably" or "might" when facts suffice.

**Formatting Conventions**: Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 for chapters, H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections). Code blocks MUST specify language for syntax highlighting. Diagrams MUST have descriptive captions and alt text.

**Terminology**: Introduce terms with clear definitions. Once defined, use consistent terminology throughout. Avoid synonyms for the same concept unless deliberately distinguishing nuances.

**Citations and References**: All claims beyond fundamental concepts SHOULD cite sources. Reference lists MUST follow a consistent citation style (e.g., author-date, numbered).

## Quality Process

**Draft Review**: Every chapter MUST be reviewed by at least one peer for clarity and accuracy before finalization. Code examples MUST be executed in the target environment during review.

**Iteration Cadence**: Feedback SHOULD be incorporated within one business week of receipt. Major restructurings MUST be versioned and documented.

**Publication Workflow**: Draft → Peer Review → Author Revision → Technical Validation → Final Review → Publication. Each stage MUST have explicit completion criteria.

**Errata Handling**: Errors discovered post-publication MUST be logged and addressed in subsequent revisions. Critical errors MUST trigger immediate errata notes.

## Governance

This constitution SUPERSEDES all other writing guidelines. Amendments REQUIRE documentation of rationale and impact. Changes to core principles MUST be approved by the primary author(s). Compliance MUST be verified during each quality review cycle.
